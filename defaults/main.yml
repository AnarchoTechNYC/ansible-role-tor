# Default variable assignments for Tor role.
#
# This file provides defaults for variables used by the Ansible role.
# You can override any of these variables using Ansible's precendence
# rules by supplying new variables of the same name in your own plays.

# Tor configuration directives are almost one-to-one mappings between
# the variables in this dictionary and their `torrc` file counterparts
# described in the Tor manual. Exceptions are `HiddenService*` and the
# `HidServAuth` directives.
#
# When left undefined (commented out), no associated line will be
# written to the `torrc` configuration file. Directives that can be
# specified multiple times are written as YAML lists and their names
# have been pluralized.
#
# As this is a dictionary, if you want to override a single variable,
# you will need to use the `combine()` filter or configure Ansible to
# set `DEFAULT_HASH_BEHAVIOR` to `merge`. The recommended way to merge
# dictionaries is with the `combine()` filter. More infromation can be
# found in the Ansible documentation:
#
#     https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/config.html#default-hash-behaviour
#
# Leaving the `torrc` dictionary undefined results in an error. Ensure
# it is present even if it is empty. An empty `torrc` dictionary means
# that the Tor software's default values will be used.
